# WordGuesser
Create a Java CLI game that allows the user to guess a word randomly picked from a list of words.
If the user guesses a letter that is contained in the word. The next output will display the word with the letters they guessed correctly (including any previously correct guesses). 
The program will remember past correct guesses and letter placements. If there are two or more of the same letters guessed, all spots with that character will be filled in.
